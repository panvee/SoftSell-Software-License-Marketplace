# 🚀 SoftSell - Software License Marketplace

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my internship project for Credex. I've built a modern, responsive landing page for SoftSell - a fictional software license resale platform. Here's everything you need to know about the project!

## 🎯 What I Built

I created a single-page marketing website that helps businesses sell their unused software licenses. The site includes:

- A clean, modern hero section that gets straight to the point
- An intuitive "How It Works" section showing the 3-step process
- Trust indicators and key benefits
- Real-world-looking testimonials
- A lead capture form with validation
- A smart chat widget (with mock AI responses)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Here's what I used to build this:

- **React + Vite** - For a super fast development experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - For responsive, clean styling
- **Framer Motion** - For those smooth animations
- **React Icons** - For consistent, scalable icons
- **React Helmet** - For proper SEO meta tags

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd softsell
   npm install
   ```

3. Fire up the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

And you're all set! The site should be running at http://localhost:3000 🎉

## 💡 Design Choices

I made several conscious decisions while building this:

- Made the chat widget non-intrusive but easily accessible
